## Disclaimer from [wiki.switchroot.org](https://wiki.switchroot.org/en/Android/Build-11#:~:text=We%20highly%20recommend,all%20kernel%20files.)
Android 11 is not ready for release or for public usage. The source trees may
have missing bits or be incomplete, and issues will be present until the final
release. If you'd like to test Android 11 builds, you can ask to be a tester on
the Switchroot Discord server [here](https://discord.com/invite/N9PPYXjWMY).

## PSA and Licensing
LineageOS 18.1/Android 11/R for the Switch is an early work in progress. Do not
expect support or help or even a functional product. Please do not follow this
guide unless you have been directed to test 11 building by a Switchroot developer
or plan to contribute in some way--just use 10 as it is stable and more fully-featured.
Uploading repo copies without the original git history or unofficial builds without
credit is a violation of the Apache License, version 2.0, for all AOSP, LineageOS Project,
and Switchroot (via personal copyright) copyright-labelled files. The Linux kernel is
licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2, and the same requirement for
history and/or credit applies to all kernel files.

If you want to be sure that everything works, take a LineageOS 17.1 Build from [here](https://download.switchroot.org/android-10/)
